txt_tutor=`* Functions and recursion

@ ./tutorial_learn.html@A more basic tutorial for beginners can be found here.

* Functions

+ Functions are defined with *func* and called with *call*. The syntax of a function definition is: *func <func_name> <value parameters> . <reference parameters> .*

+ Variables that occur for the first time within a function are local to that function. Global variables declared above can be accessed.

# compute the greatest common divisor
#
func gcd a b . res .
  while b <> 0
    h = b
    b = a mod b
    a = h
  .
  res = a
.
call gcd 120 35 r
print r

+ *a*, *b* are value parameters, *res* is a reference (or inout) parameter and *h* is a local variable.

* Recursive functions

+ The factorial of a number *n* is the product of numbers from *1* to *n*: *n! = n ** (n - 1) ** . . . ** 2 ** 1*

+ This can be easily calculated

# factorial iterative
#
func fact n . res .
  res = 1
  while n > 1
    res = res * n
    n -= 1
  .
.
call fact 6 res
print res

+ The factorial can be defined recursively: *n! = n ** (n - 1)!* and *1! = 1*

+ It can also be calculated recursively

# factorial recursive
#
func fact n . res .
  if n > 1
    call fact n - 1 h
    res = n * h
  else
    res = 1
  .
.
call fact 6 res
print res

+ The function is called within the function. Each calling instance requires a new set of local variables and parameters. This and the return address are stored on the stack. The recursion depth is limited to 10000.

* Fractal tree

+ A simple tree can be viewed recursively. It consists of a branch at the end of which two smaller trees, one slightly inclined to the left, the other slightly to the right, grow out. 

+ Such a tree can be drawn relatively easily with a recursive program.

func tree x y angle depth . .
  if depth > 0
    linewidth depth * 0.4
    move x y
    x += cos angle * depth * 1.4 * (randomf + 0.5)
    y += sin angle * depth * 1.4 * (randomf + 0.5)
    line x y
    call tree x y angle - 20 depth - 1
    call tree x y angle + 20 depth - 1
  .
.
call tree 50 90 -90 10

* Quicksort

+ Each recursive call of a function requires stack memory, which is limited. Therefore you should avoid a too deep recursion. This can be done, for example, by replacing the recursive call, that would be the last action of the function, with a loop.

intvars
func qsort left right . data[] .
  # 
  subr partition
    swap data[(left + right) / 2] data[left]
    mid = left
    for i = left + 1 to right 
      if data[i] < data[left]
        mid += 1
        swap data[i] data[mid]
      .
    .
    swap data[left] data[mid]
  .
  # 
  while left < right
    call partition
    call qsort left mid - 1 data[]
    left = mid + 1
  .
.
data[] = [ 29 4 72 44 55 26 27 77 92 5 ]
call qsort 0 len data[] - 1 data[]
print data[]

+ The subroutine *partition* is defined within the function *sort*. In the subroutine *partition*, access to the local variables of the function *sort* is then also possible.

* Tower of Hanoi

+ There are three places and some discs of different sizes. The discs are in first place in ascending size. They must be reallocated to second place.  The third place can be used. Only one disc can be moved at a time. The discs must be taken from above and placed on top of the target, whereby the disc underneath must be larger.

+ The problem can be solved recursively: To move *n* discs to the target place, move *n-1* discs to the auxiliary place, then give the lowest disc to the target and then move the *n-1* discs from the auxiliary place to the target place.

# tower of hanoi
intvars 
n_discs = 5
func hanoi n src dst aux . .
  if n >= 1
    call hanoi n - 1 src aux dst
    print "move " & src & " to " & dst
    call hanoi n - 1 aux dst src
  .
.
call hanoi n_discs 1 2 3

* Eight queens puzzle

+ In the 8-queens problem you should place 8 queens on a chessboard, so that no two queens threaten each other. Two queens are therefore not allowed on the same row, column or diagonal.

+ This problem that can be solved using recursive backtracking. With backtracking you try to find a solution step by step. There are different paths with each step. If one step shows that the current path will not lead to a solution, go back to the previous step and choose another path.

# queens puzzle

# stores the position of the queen on row
